## Anxend Interview Mini Project

### Project 3:

Display a stacked bar chart showing mental health questionniare scores for a school. Use a bar to represent each school year. Split the scores in each year into quartiles (any range and total score is fine) and display the quartiles in a stacked bar chart (so each quartile for that year is stacked on top of each other). Generate some simple dummy data that has the year and the results and can be used for your chart. The visx library would be a good option to help display the results.

To get started make sure your have nodejs setup on your system and then:

### Install Dependencies
